  <summary>¿What is the challange about?</summary>
 - The Maze system is a game where a character must navigate through a maze composed of different types of terrains, such as ground, sand, walls, low grass, medium grass, high grass, water, and turbulent water. The goal of the game is for the player to find the exit of the maze. The character's speed varies depending on the type of terrain they are on. Additionally, the game includes a day and night cycle with changes in visibility and visual elements such as the sky and the sun.

## ¿What does the system do?
 + The Maze Challenge project is developed as a solution to level up the initial maze game. The initial maze consists of three layers and provides a single means of transportation, which is a boat. The objective of this project is to enhance the game by implementing additional features such as a day and night cycle, diverse terrains, and a dynamic gameplay experience.

 + The project was requested to provide an upgraded version of the initial maze game to offer players a more immersive and challenging experience. By introducing new elements like a day and night cycle, varied terrains, and the ability to navigate on foot, the game becomes more engaging and complex, requiring players to make strategic decisions and adapt to different conditions within the maze.

+ The need that this project aims to address is to create a more captivating and enjoyable gaming experience for players who seek a maze challenge that goes beyond the simplicity of the initial version. By expanding the gameplay elements and introducing new dynamics, the project meets the demand for a game that stimulates critical thinking, problem-solving, and exploration within the context of a maze
  
## The system provides the following functionalities:
  | Functionality         | Description                                                                                                                          |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Maze Exploration       | The player can control a character to navigate through the maze using various modes of transportation such as walking, riding a horse, and sailing in a boat. |
| Terrain Effects        | Each terrain type in the maze affects the player's movement speed, requiring strategic decisions to optimize navigation.                       |
| Day and Night Cycle    | The system includes a realistic day and night cycle, with corresponding changes in the visibility and atmosphere of the maze.                  |
| Tool Utilization       | The player can utilize helpful tools available within the maze to overcome challenges and gain advantages, such as using a flying carpet to traverse mountains. |
| Maze Visualization     | The system provides a graphical representation of the maze, displaying different terrains and obstacles to enhance the player's immersion and gameplay experience. |
